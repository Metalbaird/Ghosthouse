	<h1> You walk towards the TVs, noticing the thick layer of grime on the old glass screen. The red standby light at the bottom of the screen flirkers ominiously.<br> The TV remote is on the coffee table surrounded by broken coffee cups and rotten food. You notice that the only button on the remote that isn't covered in black filth, is the power button. <br>You also see that there is an old metal dial on the front of the TV itself, as an old power switch.</h1>

	<h1> You walk towards the TV, noticing the thick layer of grime on the old glass screen. The red standby light at the bottom of the screen flirkers ominiously.<br><br> The TV remote sits atop the bulky screen, and there is an old metal dial on the front of the TV itself, as an old power switch. <br> <br>You notice that the only button on the remote that isn't covered in black filth, is the power button.<br></h1>

	<h1> The cellar smells worse than the kitchen, but you can't place the food that this smell of rot comes from... <br> In the darkness of a corner you see a slight golden twinkle, like a lone star in the nights sky. <br> You also see a hatch used for delivering coal, although the hatch looks damaged.</h1>

	<h1> As you enter the study, you feel a crippling sense of being watched. The dark corners seem to close in on you are you walk to the centre of the room.  <br> 
	<br>Through the filthy air, you notice an antique desk  with a parchment and inkwell, laid out as if it was recently in use. <br><br> You also notice two oddly preserved hunting trophies, free from grime and their mouths open. From here you can't fully make out what animals they are.

	<h1> You look into the cunning Fox's eyes to check for signs of life, but nothing stands out. You slide your arm deep into the Fox's mouth, searching for the key.<br><br>The mouth of the Fox feels warm and alive. In a shock, you look up to meet the Fox's gaze again and this time you see the Fox wink at you. As the Fox winks, you feel your hand grasp a metal object.
	<br><br> You pull your arm from the Fox's mouth, covered in slime and sinue. As disgusting as your arm feels, you notice in your hand is a heavy iron key!

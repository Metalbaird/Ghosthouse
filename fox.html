	<h1> You look into the cunning Fox's eyes to check for signs of life, but nothing. You slide your arm deep into the Fox's mouth, searching for a key.<br><br>The mouth of the fox feels warm and alive. In a shock you look up to meet the foxes gaze again, and this time you see the Fox wink at you, as you feel your hand grasp a metal object.
	<br><br> You pull your arm from the Fox's mouth, covered in slime and sinue. As disgusting as your arm feels, you notice in your hand is a heavy iron key!

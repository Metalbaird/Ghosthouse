	<h1> You pick up the old fountain pen and dip it into the inkwell, your hand shakes slightly as you begin to write "Give me the key to escape"  <br> 
	<br>As you finish writing, you feel liek something isn't right. <br><br> You begin to cough and splutter as you feel something fill your throat, and a small key falls out. Another key then follows, and then another.<br><br> Before you know it, you are coughing up key after key after key. <br> you collapse, keys flowing out of your mouth like water.	</h1>

	<h2>Game Over! - A thousand handcuff keys have choked you to death, your body sags the floor with the weight of the keys.</h2>

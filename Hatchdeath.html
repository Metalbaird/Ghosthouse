	<h1> You keep trying to open the damaged hatch, even faster knowing there is something behind you. <br> You bash the hatch one final time,<br> and light shines through into the dark cellar. You hear a ferocious scream as what feels like a dozen hands grab you back into the darkness... where you remain to this day...</h1>

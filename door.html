	<h1> You get a bit of a run up and launch yourself at the heavy back door. You fall backwards onto the filthy floor looking back up at the door, it mearly shaked when you hit it. <br><br>	You can see that one of the glass panes has broken, with lethaly sharp knives of glass sticking violently outwards. You are relieved you didn't try breaking the glass.</h1>

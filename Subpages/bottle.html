	<h1 id="h1" style="opacity:0;"> As you pick up the bottle, you see that the ship moves slightly from side to side as if in rough waters. <br> You tightly grab the cork stopper on the bottle and twist.
	<br> After a solid minute of grunting and pulling, the cork starts to come away<br><br>
	As you pull the cork away, you feel strange, as if you're flying through the air at great speed. You close your eyes to stop the gusts of wind from blinding you.
	<br> With your eyes closed you hear something out of place, waves crash near you and the sounds of seaguls can be heard.
	<br> You open your eyes and see you are now inside the bottle, trapped! 
	<br>Slowly you turn to see a large group of angry sailors have noticed your arrival...
	
	<br><br>
	Game Over<br><br>You've entered the bottle and have been forced to swab the decks for all eternity.

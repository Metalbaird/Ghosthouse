	<br> You apologise for nearling poking the GHOUL's eye. <br>You ask the GHOUL how it's ended up in such a place.<br> The GHOUL is taken aback with your words, and explains that it's trapped in the cellar of the house. <br>
	The GHOUL explains that it's name is Gary, and would love for you to unlock the front door so they can escape.<br>
	You notice a tear roll down Gary's cheek, it seems like he just need a conversation and a wee cry.<br>

	Gary blows his nose on a ruined tea towel and thanks you for speaking with him. 
	<br>He gives you a KEY to the <b>Livingroom!</b>
	<br>
	<br>
	The <b>Livingroom</b> is now unlocked!

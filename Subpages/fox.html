	<h1 id="h1" style="opacity:0;"> You look into the cunning Fox's eyes to check for signs of life,<br>But nothing stands out. You slide your arm deep into the Fox's mouth, searching for the key.<br><br>The mouth of the Fox feels warm and alive. In a shock, you look up to meet the Fox's gaze again<br>But, this time you see the Fox wink at you.<br>As the Fox winks, you feel your hand grasp a metal object.
	<br><br> You pull your arm from the Fox's mouth, covered in slime and sinue.<br> As disgusting as your arm feels, you notice in your hand is a heavy iron key!
	<br><br> 
	
	You have found the key to the front door! Time to escape!

	<a href="escape.html">Run to the foyer and get the hell out of this house?</a>

	<h1 id="h1" style="opacity:0;"> You pick up the old fountain pen and dip it into the inkwell, your hand shakes slightly as you begin to write<br>"Give me the key to escape"  <br> 
	<br>As you finish writing, you feel like something isn't right. <br>
	You begin to cough and splutter as you feel something fill your throat<br>You cough up a small metal key.<br>And another<br> And another...<br><br>
	Before you know it, you are coughing up key, after key, after key. <br> You collapse, keys flowing out of your mouth like water.
	<br><br>
	Game Over!<br><br>A thousand keys have choked you to death<br>Your body sags the floor with the weight of the keys.

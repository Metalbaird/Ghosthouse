	<h1 id="h1" style="opacity:0;"> You walk towards the bookcase, avoiding the debris of rotten books and rags on the floor.<br> Your attention is caught by a small ship in a bottle, 
	it's glass rippling in the candlelight.<br> The ship inside the bottle seems strange,<br>it looks like the ships sails are blowing within the bottle.<br> 
	The flag on this ship is all black, with a golden key brightly adorned in the tiny fabric.<br> Seeing this key brings you hope!

	<h1 id="h1" style="opacity:0;"> As you enter the study, you feel a crippling sense of being watched.<br>The dark corners seem to close in on you are you walk to the centre of the room.  <br> 
	<br>Through the filthy air, you notice an antique desk with a parchment and inkwell,<br>
	laid out as if it was recently in use. <br> You also notice two oddly preserved hunting trophies, free from any grime and their mouths wide open.<br>
	From here you can't fully make out what animals they are.

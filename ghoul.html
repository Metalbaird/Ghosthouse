	<h1>You slowly edge towards the glint of golden in the darkness. <br><br> As your hand gets closer, you notice that the golden glint has a small black dot in the middle of the deep gold shine. <br><br>The black dot follows your hand and you realise that, as your fingers squishes into the golden circle, that it's not a key, but an eye.</h1>

	<h2> Game Over! - You poked a ghoul in the eye, and it ripped your arm off. Your body will feed the other foul creatures that exist in the cellar.</h2>

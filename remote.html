	<h1> You pick up the remote and turn the TV on without issue, but there is no signal. <br> The static of the TV gives you a shock as it pierces the silence of the livingroom. <br> You try to turn the TV off, but the remote doesn't respond. The static is getting louder, and louder, until you can't stand it anymore.<br>
		You back away to the livingroom door, and as you get there, the TV explodes with glass and shrapnel wizzing past you. Close one!

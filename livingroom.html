	<h1> The livingroom is dimly lit by an old candle, the scent of dust and grime fills your nostrils.<br> Looking around, you notice an old 1980's style TV with a red standby light on, with the remote sitting on top of the TV.<br><br>
		You also notice a large book case, with many dusty books but something glinting in the candlelight.</h1>
